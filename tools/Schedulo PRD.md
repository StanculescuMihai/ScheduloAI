### **A Note on Modern PRDs**

Before the template, remember that a modern PRD is:

* **A Tool for Collaboration:** It's not a contract you hand off. It's a starting point for discussion with engineering, design, marketing, and other stakeholders.  
* **Focused on Problems, Not Just Solutions:** It clearly articulates the user problem and business need, providing context for every requirement.  
* **A Living Document:** It will change. As you learn more through development and user feedback, update the PRD. Use a tool like Confluence, Notion, or Google Docs that supports version history and comments.

### **1\. Overview: The "Why"** 

*This project aims to build a smart productivity assistant that helps users manage their day with minimal effort by learning from their routines and behavior. Instead of relying on static reminders or manual planning, the assistant intelligently adapts to the user’s habits, suggests tasks, reschedules conflicting events, and prioritizes what’s most important — all powered by AI. By reducing cognitive load and saving time, the assistant supports users in staying focused, consistent, and balanced throughout their day.*

#### **1.1. Problem Statement**

*Modern users are overloaded with managing tasks across multiple platforms—calendars, to-do lists, and messaging apps. These tools lack adaptability — they don’t learn from user behavior, can’t respond to unexpected schedule changes, and don’t help with prioritization or time estimation. As a result, users experience cognitive overload, wasted time, missed tasks, and increased stress, especially during busy or unpredictable days. There is a clear need for a more intelligent, proactive system that understands the user’s routine and supports flexible, automated daily planning.*

#### **1.2. Proposed Solution**

*We will build a smart, AI-powered productivity assistant that learns from user behavior and daily patterns. The app will automatically generate reminders, reschedule tasks, suggest optimal timing based on productivity patterns, and interact with users via chat or voice. It will act as a personalized productivity coach that helps users work smarter and reduce friction in task management.*

#### **1.3. Strategic Alignment / Business Case**

*This feature directly supports our strategic objective of increasing user retention and boosting daily engagement through advanced personalization. By utilizing AI-driven algorithms that continuously learn and adapt to each user’s unique habits and routines, the app can provide timely, relevant reminders and smart task suggestions. This habit-aware intelligence ensures users receive assistance that feels natural and intuitive, reducing manual input and improving overall productivity. As a result, we anticipate a significant increase in the number of daily active users, longer session durations, and deeper user satisfaction and loyalty over time.*

### **2\. Goals & Success Metrics: "How We'll Measure Success"**

*Define what success looks like in measurable terms. Differentiate between the goals (the outcome) and the metrics (the measurement).*

#### **2.1. Goals**

*What are the primary and secondary goals? Think in terms of user outcomes and business impact.*

* **User Goal:**  Transform the user’s relationship with time management from one of reactive anxiety to one of proactive control, giving them the confidence that their schedule is always optimized. Transform the user’s relationship with time management from one of reactive anxiety to one of proactive control, giving them the confidence that their schedule is always optimized.  
* **Business Goal:** Create a powerful competitive moat by building a deeply personalized experience that is difficult to replicate. This "stickiness" will be our primary driver for converting free users to a future premium tier.  
* **Technical Goal:** Develop a foundational, privacy-first data science capability. This framework must not only be scalable and accurate but also serve as the ethical bedrock for how we leverage user data to create value.


#### **2.2. Success Metrics (KPIs) (NU FOLOSIM ACEASTA SECTIUNE INCA)**

*How will you know you've achieved your goals? These should be specific, measurable, and trackable.*

| Metric | Description & Target |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Adoption Rate** | % of target users who use the dashboard \>2 times in their first week. **Target: 40%** |
| **Task Completion Rate** | % of users who successfully create and save a dashboard view. **Target: 95%** |
| **Time-to-Value** | Average time it takes a user to get meaningful insight from the dashboard. **Target: \< 60 seconds** |
| **Retention Impact** | 3-month retention rate of users who adopt the dashboard vs. those who don't. **Target: \+5% lift** |
| **Support Tickets** | Reduction in tickets related to "reporting" or "project overview." **Target: \-10%** |

### **3\. Target Audience: "Who We're Building For"**

* **Primary Person: "Alex the Overextended Professional" \-** A 30-year-old consultant whose primary professional asset is strategic thinking, but whose time is consumed by the administrative battle against their own calendar. Alex juggles multiple client projects, internal team meetings, and personal goals (fitness, networking), leading to significant cognitive overload. They are tech-savvy but time-poor, and their current system of reactive planning makes them feel constantly behind. They don't just need a better to-do list; they need an intelligent system that anticipates needs so they can appear effortlessly in control.  
    
* **Secondary Person: "Sam the Student Procrastinator" \-** A 20-year-old university student facing the paradox of unstructured freedom. Their schedule is a chaotic mix of classes, fluctuating part-time work hours, looming assignment deadlines, and a social life. Without the rigid structure of a 9-to-5 job, Sam struggles with initiating tasks and falls into cycles of procrastination followed by last-minute panic. They need more than just reminders; they need an intelligent coach that provides scaffolding for their day, helps build momentum, and offers guidance on balancing work and rest.


### **4\. Requirements & Scope: The "What" (CEA MAI IMPORTANTA SECTIUNE)**

*This is the core of the PRD. Detail what needs to be built using user stories. Prioritize everything.*

#### **4.1. User Stories (important\!)**

*List the user stories in priority order (P0 \= Must-have for launch, P1 \= Important, P2 \= Nice-to-have).*

| ID | Priority | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| US-01 | P0 | As a user, I want the app to integrate with my calendar and messages, so it can detect events or deadlines without me inputting them manually. | \- Connect to Google/Outlook calendar via secure OAuth.  \- Read event data (title, time) as read-only.  \- Suggest new tasks based on keywords in connected messages. | Privacy & Security are paramount. User must explicitly grant permissions with clear explanations. |
| US-02 | P0 | As a user, I want the app to learn my routine over time, so it can suggest tasks or reminders that match my usual schedule. | \- Identify recurring user habits after a learning period.  \- Prompt user to formally add the identified habit to their routine. |  |
| US-03 | P1 | As a user, I want to receive smart reminders based on my daily habits, so I don’t have to manually set every task. | \- Learn the user's typical completion time for specific task types.  \- Send reminders at the learned optimal time, even if unset by the user. |  |
| US-04 | P1 | As a user, I want the app to reschedule my tasks automatically if there’s a conflict or delay, so I don’t have to reorganize everything myself. | \- Detect scheduling conflicts with newly added calendar events.  \- Propose a new, available time slot for the conflicting task.  \- Allow user to approve or reject the suggestion with one tap. |  |
| US-05 | P2 | As a user, I want the app to prioritize tasks based on urgency and past behavior, so I always know what’s most important. | \- \-Automatically increase task priority based on keywords (e.g., 'ASAP').  \- Adjust task priority based on learned user behavior (e.g., what they do first). |  |

#### **4.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

*These are system-level constraints, often called the "-ilities."*

* **Performance:** Data synchronization across all user devices must complete within 1 second to ensure a seamless experience.  
* **Security:** User data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest, adhering strictly to GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.  
* **Accessibility:** The user interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities.  
* **Localization:** All UI text and strings should be fully translatable and designed to support easy localization for multiple languages.


#### **4.3. Out of Scope (important\!)**

*Be explicit about what you are not building to prevent scope creep and manage expectations.*

* Support for customizable visual themes and application skins.  
* Social media sharing capabilities directly from the app.  
* Exporting tasks or reports in uncommon formats (e.g., XML, JSON, advanced PDF).  
* Notifications related to weather or other external information not directly relevant to productivity.


### **5\. Design & User Experience: "How It Looks & Feels"**

  * *Dashboard Creation:* The flow for selecting projects. \[Embed image/link\]  
  * *Populated Dashboard:* The main view with data. \[Embed image/link\]  
* 

### **6\. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan (NU FOLOSIM ACEASTA SECTIUNE INCA)**

*How will you release this to the world? This ensures cross-functional alignment.*

* **Phasing:**  
  * **Internal Alpha:** \[Date\] \- Release to internal employees for dogfooding.  
  * **Closed Beta:** \[Date\] \- Release to a select group of power users.  
  * **General Availability (GA):** \[Date\] \- Full release to 100% of users.  
*   
* **Dependencies:**  
  * **Marketing:** Blog post and in-app announcement need to be ready by \[Date\].  
  * **Support:** Help documentation and agent training must be completed by \[Date\].  
  * **Sales:** One-pager on new functionality for sales enablement.  
* 

### **7\. Future Work & Open Questions (neimportant)**

*A place to acknowledge what's next and what you still don't know. This fosters transparency.*

#### **7.1. Future Iterations (V2, V3)**

*What ideas are already on the roadmap for after this initial launch?*

* Customizable columns in the dashboard.  
* Export to CSV/PDF.  
* Conditional formatting (e.g., turn a project red if it's overdue).

#### **7.2. Open Questions & Assumptions**

*List any open questions or assumptions that need to be resolved or validated.*

* **Question:** What is the technical performance impact of refreshing data for 50+ projects at once? (Needs investigation by Eng).  
* **Assumption:** We assume users want a table view first, rather than a card-based or timeline view. (Will validate in Beta).  
* **Question:** Do we need to support sharing with specific people, or is a public link sufficient for V1? (Needs discussion with security/users).
